This contains the practice tests for the Red Hat EX413 exam. Note that I have not yet taken the exam, so this is based purely from the exam objectives and third party resources.

# Resources

There are not much resources on the EX413 exam. If you know if any, please shoot me an email or make a pull request. NO EXAM DUMPS OR LINKS TO THEM WILL BE ACCEPTED.

## Formal

[Red Hat Server Hardening](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/rh413-red-hat-server-hardening) - Official Red Hat Training

## Third Party

[RedHat/EX413 notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uTvpPFj5vlcLTkYR2YMdyBldBL47pyZ5AJIZ-u2pMrQ/edit#) A google doc that contains what you need to practice.
[Red Hat Certificate of Expertise in Server Hardening - Exam EX413 Training](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/red-hat-certificate/9781491974483/) - From Sander Van Vugt, author of the well-regarded [RHCE](http://www.sandervanvugt.com/book-red-hat-rhcsa-rhce-7-cert-guide/) (and incidentally, have an excellent guide on installing FreeIPA).

# Setup

Have two virtual machines, instances (or a combination of both). One should be designated as the "server", while the other will be the workstation. If possible, use Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, either from AWS or through the [Free Developer License](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2016/03/31/no-cost-rhel-developer-subscription-now-available/). That said, CentOS 7 will do just fine. The disk size should be at least 10-20 gigabytes, with 5 gigabytes free.

# Documentation

TBD
